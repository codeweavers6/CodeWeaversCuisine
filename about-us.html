            <h1>Code Weavers Cuisine</h1>

            <p>
                Code Weavers started Code Weavers Cuisine because we Believe food taste matter and we found that usually
                resturants do their food based only on menu and this menu tell us what we should taste, and we don't all
                agree on that.
            </p>

            <p>
                That's why We (Code Weavers team) took this seriously and we decided to take revolutionary step and take
                different directions not only allow our customers to try famous meals, but also they can create their
                own meals.
            </p>

            <p>
                Along the way, our customers will get the chance make their own gredients list and we will cook it based
                on customer desire by professional and certified cook.
            </p>

            <p>
                We want to be your trusted partner when it come to food and your own personal preferece and we will do
                our best so you have best experience.
            </p>
